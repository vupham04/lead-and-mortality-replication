# Replication Project - Lead and Mortality
The purpose of this report is to replicate the results of the paper Lead and Mortality
written by Karen Clay, Werner Troesken, and Michael Haines using Stata, discuss the replication
results, and briefly introduce possible extensions to the phenomena in the study. The project uses Stata

<h3>INSIDE THE FOLDER</h3>

In project folder Burstein-Howe-Pham-298-Replication, there are 3 files: finalpaper.pdf,
finalpaper.docx, readme.pdf

- finalpaper.pdf (final replication report in pdf format)
- finalpaper.docx (final replication report in Word format)
and two folders: Analysis and Data

In folder Analysis, there are 3 files:

- Analysis.do (do file that produces figures and regression results)
- Analysis.log (log file logging results of Analysis.do)
- Figure1.gph (a copy of Figure 1)

In folder Data, there is 1 file:
- lead_mortality.dta (the original data set used to produce figures and regression results)

<h3>HOW TO REPLICATE THE DATA AND REPRODUCE THE GRAPHS AND REGRESSION TABLES:</h3>

- Open the Stata software
- Change the working directory to the project folder â€¦/Burstein-Howe-Pham-298-
Replication
- Open the do file Analysis.do
- Run that do file on Stata

Note: After running a do file, a copy of Figure1.gph will be saved (and replaced) in the Analysis
folder and three regression tables will be exports as .xls files as Table3.xls, Table4.xls, and
Table5.xls in the working directory folder
